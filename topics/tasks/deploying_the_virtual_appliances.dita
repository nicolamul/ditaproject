    <title>Deploying the virtual appliances</title>
    <taskbody>
        <context>Use VMware vSphere Client to deploy the virtual appliances to an ESX server. Deploy
            OVAs for the gateway, the data server, and the application stack, preferably in this
            order. If an Elasticsearch cluster is also being deployed, those OVAs must be deployed
                first.<p>Ensure that all prerequisites for the deployment described in the planning
                section are met and that the required software packages are available on your local
                system before you start this task.</p><p>Download the latest version of IBM StoredIQ
                from either IBM Fix Central or IBM Passport AdvantageÂ®. For information about the
                package names and part numbers and the links to the proper download locations, see
                the download document.</p><p>The number of Elasticsearch OVAs deployed depends on
                the planned size of your Elasticsearch cluster. The default setup is a three-node
                cluster. Each Elasticsearch node requires a separate OVA deployment.</p><p>The
                number of data server OVAs deployed depends on the number of data servers needed.
                Each data server requires a separate OVA deployment.</p></context>
